# algo.generic

Generic versions of commonly used functions, implemented as multimethods
that can be implemented for any data type.

## Usage

Each submodule of clojure.algo.generic defines a set of related
multimethods that have the same names as their type-specific
counterparts in clojure.core. Implementations for standard Clojure
data types are provided and behave identically to the clojure.core
versions.

### Arities

Arithmetic and comparison functions are defined for the same arities
that the corresponding clojure.core functions support.  Arities higher
than 2 are reduced to unary and binary calls. To provide a multimethod
implementation for binary calls with a given pair of types, use
`[type1 type2]` as the dispatch value. For a unary call, the dispatch
value is `type` as usual. Note that `[type1 type2]` is different from
`[type2 type1]` (in most cases you will want to provide both) and that
`[type type]` (binary operation with both arguments of the same type)
is different from `type` (unary operation).

### Root type

This section applies only to binary operations dispatching on type
pairs, and only for types that are *not* Java classes. Types
created by `deftype` and `defrecord` are Java classes, meaning that
most Clojure programmers can go on with the next section.

One difficulty with binary operations is that there is no predefined
way to provide a default implementation. For single dispatch there is
`:default`, but there is nothing equivalent to `[:default :default]`.
The algo.generic library therefore defines a *root type*, accessible
as `clojure.algo.generic/root-type`, which is used in the default
implementations of binary operations. To integrate your own type into
this system, you must add the clause `(derive my-type
clojure.algo.generic/root-type)` after your type definition. This is
not required for Java classes because `java.lang.Object` is
already derived from `root-type`.

### Submodules

* **algo.generic.arithmetic** provides generic `+` `-` `*` `/` for all
  the arities that the corresponding clojure.core functions support.
  The minimal implementations required for full arithmetic on a given
  type is binary `+` and `*` and unary `-` and `/`. You may wish to
  provide explicit implementations for binary `-` and `/` for
  efficiency, otherwise the default implementations are `(- a b) => (+ a (- b))`
   and `(/ a b) => (* a (/ b))`.

* **algo.generic.collection** provides generic versions of `assoc`,
  `dissoc`, `get`, `conj`, `empty`, `into`, and `seq`. `into` has a
  default implementation in terms of `conj` and `seq`, but you may
  wish to provide a more efficient one for your types.

* **algo.generic.comparison** provides the comparison and test
  functions `=`, `not=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `zero?`, `pos?`,
  `neg?`, `min`, and ` max`. `not=`, `min`, and `max` cannot be
  redefined, they are standard functions that are implemented in
  terms of the generic functions of the module. A minimal
  implementation of the binary comparison functions consists of
  `=` and `>`. Default implementations for `<`, `<=`, and `>=`
  call `>`, but more efficient implementations can be provided.

* **algo.generic.functor** provides a generic functor interface (`fmap`).

* **algo.generic.math-functions** provides generic versions of the
  common math functions from `java.lang.Math`, plus `sgn`, `sqr`, and
  `conjugate`.
